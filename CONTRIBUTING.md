Please review the complete guidelines at: https://github.com/gavdilabs/GitGuidelines

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Find or Create an Issue
- **Find an Issue**: Browse our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gavdilabs/solutioncentral/issues) for open issues
- **Create New Issue**: If you have a new idea, create an issue first to discuss it with maintainers

### Step 2: Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/solutioncentral.git
cd solutioncentral

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/gavdilabs/solutioncentral.git
```

### Step 3: Create Your Feature Branch
Follow our strict naming convention (see [Branch Naming Convention](#branch-naming-convention) below).

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature-branch_name-MM-YYYY
```

## Branch Naming Convention

Branch names MUST follow this exact format:

### For Features:
```
feature-name_of_feature_with_underscores-MM-YYYY
```
Example: `feature-de_translation-02-2025`

### For Fixes:
```
fix-name_of_fix_with_underscores-MM-YYYY
```
Example: `fix-injection_issue_data_loader-08-2024`

### For Issue-based Fixes:
```
fix-#ISSUE_NUMBER-MM-YYYY
```
Example: `fix-#6403-10-2024`

Where:
- `MM` = Two-digit month
- `YYYY` = Four-digit year
- Use underscores for spaces in the name
- Keep names descriptive but concise

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Gavdi Git Guidelines](https://github.com/gavdilabs/GitGuidelines) for commit messages:

### Format:
```
Short summary (50 characters max)

Optional detailed description explaining:
- What you changed
- Why you changed it
- Any relevant issue numbers (#123)
```

### Rules:
- **First line**: 50 characters max, capitalized, no period
- **Body**: Wrap at 72 characters, separated by blank line
- **Voice**: Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- **Content**: Explain what and why, not how
- **References**: Include issue numbers when relevant

### Examples:
```
Add German translation support

Implements localization framework for German language
as requested in issue #123. Includes all UI strings
and help documentation.

Fixes #123
```

```
Fix data loader injection vulnerability

Prevents SQL injection in the solution import process
by implementing parameterized queries and input validation.

Fixes #456
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting:
1. **Implement your changes** following our development guidelines
2. **Add/Update Unit Tests** - Your code will not be approved without proper tests
3. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure all tests pass and no regressions
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Commit often** with clear, descriptive messages
6. **Ensure code quality** - Keep code, methods, and comments short and to the point

### Submitting:
1. **Push your branch** to your fork
2. **Create Pull Request** with a clear title describing the feature/fix
3. **Fill out PR template** with detailed description
4. **Link related issues** using "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456"

### PR Title Format:
```
[Feature/Fix]: Brief description of changes
```

Examples:
- `[Feature]: Add German localization support`

### After Submission:
- **Respond to feedback** promptly and constructively
- **Make requested changes** as new commits (don't squash until approved)
- **Keep PR updated** if main branch advances

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards:
- **Keep it simple**: Code, methods, and comments should be short and to the point
- **Follow existing patterns**: Maintain consistency with existing codebase
- **Comment wisely**: Explain why, not what
- **No magic numbers**: Use named constants
- **Handle errors**: Implement proper error handling

### Required Elements:
- **Unit Tests**: Every new feature must include comprehensive unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: For complex features affecting multiple components
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for API changes
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of your changes

### Prohibited Actions:
- **No license violations**: Don't include code that violates licenses

## Testing Requirements

All contributions MUST include appropriate tests:

### Required Test Types:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: For user-facing features (when applicable)

### Test Standards:
- Tests must pass before PR approval
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
